A sudoku board helper.

This program will load up a board and do the simple computations on it.

1) Mark all numbers impossible that are already present on the same row, column, or block.
2) Mark a number as the only possibility if it is the only cell in that row, column, or block that can contain that number.
3) Do inference on two or more cells at a time with the same logic as (1) and (2).  Meaning, if two cells in a block are the only numbers that can contain a given two values, then they must contain those two values (all other possibilities are impossible).  And, if two cells in a block can only have two values, then no other cell in the same block can take on those values.

It is possible to construct sudoku which cannot be solved in this manner, but require guessing and backtracking.

Somewhere I have code which does guessing and backtracking and creates lists of boards of varying levels of difficulty.  Whenever I find the code in my archives I'll update this project.

It's possible this code is a snapshot which doesn't work particularly well.
